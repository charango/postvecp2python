# postvecp2python
Overview: postvecp2python is a Python program to visualize the results of linear hydrodynamical simulations modeling oscillation modes in stars and planets carried out with the LSB spectral code.

More specifically, the program allows to display meridional cuts of a mode’s kinetic energy, viscous dissipation, power in the differential rotation, thermal energy and thermal dissipation. Paths of characteristics as well as turning surfaces and critical latitudes can be overlaid. The mode’s spectral content can also be displayed. Other features (eigenfrequencies for QZ runs, total dissipation for forced runs) are also available.

Please have a look at the keynote presentation 'postvecp2python.pdf' to glance at how the code works. Enjoy!
